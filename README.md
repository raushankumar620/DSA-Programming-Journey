# 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations 

This project demonstrates the basic operations of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using the C programming language. A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and for each node, the left subtree contains nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value.

## 🚀 Features  
The project includes the following operations:
1. **Insertion**: Add a new node to the BST.
2. **Deletion**: Remove a node from the BST.
3. **Traversal**: Display the tree in three different ways:
   - **Inorder** Traversal: Left, Root, Right
   - **Preorder** Traversal: Root, Left, Right
   - **Postorder** Traversal: Left, Right, Root

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bst-operations.git

- 🌐 **Concepts Covered**: Understanding graph representation using **adjacency matrix** and **adjacency list**.
- 🔄 **Key Operations**: Adding edges, displaying the graph.

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation:
- 🧗‍♂️ **Concepts Covered**: Traversing a graph using **DFS**.
- 🔄 **Key Operations**: Recursive and iterative implementations.

## 🗓️ Day 8
### Sorting Algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:
  - 💡 **Concepts Covered**: Basic sorting technique using nested loops.

- **Merge Sort Algorithm**:
  - 💡 **Concepts Covered**: Divide and conquer technique for sorting.
  
- **QuickSort Algorithm**:
  - 💡 **Concepts Covered**: Efficient sorting using partitioning.

### Search Algorithms:
